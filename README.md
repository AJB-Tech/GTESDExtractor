# GTESDExtractor
Quickly extract audio and RPM data from Gran Turismo Sport's GTESD file format.
## Usage
Simply drag a GTESD file onto the application and it will extract everything into a folder with the same name as the GTESD file. Each audio bank is extracted as .sxd, with the corresponding RPM values in a .txt. These files can then be opened in an application such as VGMStream to convert to more standard formats.
